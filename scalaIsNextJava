James Gosling   Java语言的创立者

Someone ever asked him an interesting question:"Which Programming language would you use now on top of JVM,except java?", The answer was surprisingly fast and very clear: -Scala （May 08,2008)

 在一个社区（java.net booth）举办的和James Gosling对话会议上，一个与会者问了一个非常有意思的问题：“除了Java，现在你会把哪种语言运行于JVM之上？”。答案是惊人地快速简洁：Scala

Scala, it must be stated, is the current heir apparent to the Java throne,No other language on the JVM seems as capable of being a "replacement for Java" as Scala, and the momentum behind Scala is now unquestionable.(April 22,2009)

我必须说Scala看起来是是现在Java王座的继承人。其他在JVM的语言看起来不可能有Scala那样的能力来取代 Java，Scala背后的推动力是无可置疑的
